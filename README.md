## Description

This application uses Node.js to generate a webpage showing the information of a team of employees. The application uses the inquirer module to prompt the user to enter the information for each employee. The result is a polished webpage shown below. This project also demonstrates the use of OOP and TDD and uses Jest to run tests.
